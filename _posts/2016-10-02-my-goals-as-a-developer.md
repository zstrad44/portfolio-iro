title: My Goals as a Developer

---
If you read previous post My Developer Path you will get a little more back ground information on how I decided that I wanted to be a developer. In this post I wanted to lay out a few of my goals as a developer, which I feel 
is very important for me. When I was in high school, my football coach always told us, "A goal is just a dream, unless you write it down." Which may not be 100% accurate all the time, but I figured I would do it here in this 
post.

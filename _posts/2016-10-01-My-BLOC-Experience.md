title: My Bloc.io Experience
---

At this moment I am in my 7th week doing the Bloc program. So far I am very satisfied, and feel like I have progressed so much. To be honest though, it was not all 100% new to me, but I most of it was, especially the JavaScript.
When I decided that I was going to invest in myself and learn to program, I did a lot of research on which program I would do. I am so glad that I chose to do Bloc, their curriculim has been great, and their pace has worked out
perfect so far.  I was planning on going all in, spending 40-50 hours a week just doing the Bloc program, but it hasn't worked out that way. I have been getting lots of side work to do that has taken up a lot of my time, so 
I have been able to just keep up with the curriculum pace, and that is with me still in my office, coding for 12-14 hours a day. It has been alot and has been frustrating for my wife ofcourse, but I have learned so much 
over these last 7 weeks. 

The program started out with front end development skills, so HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. This has been awesome, they have been pretty thourough with everything that they have covered so far. It has helped me with 
my real life work, and I hav been able to apply it in real life as well. 

My mentor Alex has been great aswell, he is very knowlegable and is always helping to make sure I am doing my best. He is also very aware of what will make me more hireable, and is always giving me advice to help me 
be a better programer. 

#### Will update further as I continue to progress.

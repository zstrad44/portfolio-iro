title: My Developer Path
---


I have been doing graphic design/ front end web design since I was 16 years old and I have been doing it for the last
4 years professionally. I have always loved creating things, ever since I was young. So when I took an intro to web design/ graphic design 
class in highschool, I knew this was for me. Although I probably took the wrong/ long route to get where I really want 
to be, which is to be a full stack web developer. How did I take the wrong route might you ask?  I started using the Adobe 
software to create websites for people, it started with dreamweaver, which isn't that bad. Still a code editior. Then came Adobe Muse 
which is a full on WYSWYG editor. It will let you create full custom websites(well to a point), it it pretty much like cerating
a website using adobe ilustartor. Being pretty good at graphic design already, it was too easy to turn down. I started doing jobs for 
people and companies, and the money was too good to turn down, but years later I was bothered that I still didn't know much 
more than just the basics of HTML and CSS. If I wanted to make a website dynamic or use a database I simply didn't know how. 
That bothered me. 

I decided I was going to stop using Muse, and get serious about being a web developer. I decided I would do an online coding bootcamp,
and I chose to do the Bloc.io Web Developer track. Which i am currently in right now. I have already learned 1000x more than I knew
a few months ago no joke. My original plan was to take time off work for 3 months and hammer it out. It hasn't really worked out that
way, but I have been able to apply what I am learning at my job. I work for a data software company, which is loving my new skills. 
I am currently doing school and work right now, which is taking up about 12-14 hours a day, but I am loving every minute of it. 
Even when I am sleeping my mind is running `for` loops and trying to figure out why something didn't work earlier that day.  

My point I guess is that I feel good about the path I am on, and each day that I learn something new I get even more pumped. 

I will be writing another post with a few more details about how Bloc has been so far. So if you're interested feel free to check that out.

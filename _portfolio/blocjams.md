## Explanation

BlocJams was one of the first projects I did in the Bloc program.
It was used to help learn and test my frontend web development skills. 
The project began by building the backbone of the application layout with HTML, add styling and responsiveness using CSS, 
and implement interactivity with JavaScript.

## Problem

With any web application, it is vital to make your app ui very user fiendly, and also make sure that
it's main purpose is clear right from the start. In creating this project the problem was making sure that
both of those bases would be covered. 

## Solution 

The end result accomplished much of what I was trying to acheive from the beginning. 
- Create a functioning in browser music player app
- Make the UI simple and easy to navigate
- Learn new ways to implement data using JavaScript

## Results

This was a simple project, and one used as a guide to teach me how to use many of the new frontend 
development skills I have learned. I feel that this project was a complete success in that regard. 
I have already implemented many of the things I learned doing this project in my current job. 

## Conclusion

This web app worked like a charm. No it was not the prettiest thing in the world, but that wasn't the point. 
The idea was to learn how to create a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Mission accomplished!

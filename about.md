Hello, I'm Zach. I am very easy going and easy to get along with. I am also very determined and goal oriented. 
I have been doing web and graphic design for over 5 years, and have recently began advancing my skills in web development 
software programming. I love what I do and enjoy each and every day that I am able to create something.
